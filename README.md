# Portable Biofeedpack Device Hardware Repository

A repository that stores hardware and software files developed for the Portable Biofeedback Device, as worked on and built by students in the Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) Department of the College of Engineering & Computer Science (CECS) at the University of Central Florida (UCF) in Orlando, Florida.

The accompanying Android app was developed in Android Studio 3.5.3, making use of Android SDK/API 21 (Android 5).

All the schematics and layout is done in Kicad 5.14 along with custom libraries. These libraries are added under /Libraries.

These projects use custom path for its libraries. The custom Kicad Path variable ${KI_SDREPO} is used to increase portability. Custom variable points to the physical location of the /Libraries directory and must be declared under "Preferences > Configure Paths" setting before use.
