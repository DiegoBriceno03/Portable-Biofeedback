# Portable Biofeedpack Device Hardware Repository

A repository that stores hardware and software files developed for the Portable Biofeedback Device, as worked on and built by students in the Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) Department of the College of Engineering & Computer Science (CECS) at the University of Central Florida (UCF) in Orlando, Florida.

All the schematics and layout is done in Kicad 5.14 along with custom libraries. These libraries are added under /Footprints.

The accompanying Android app was developed in Android Studio 3.5.3, making use of Android SDK/API 21 (Android 5).
