In this repository we will have all the hardware developement for the Portable Biofeedback device. All the schematics and layout is done in Kicad 5.14 along with custom libraries. These libraries are added under /Libraries.

These projects use custom path for its libraries. The custom Kicad Path variable ${KI_SDREPO} is used to increase portability. This variable points to the physical location of the /Libraries directory and must be declared under "Preferences > Configure Paths" setting.
